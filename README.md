# Learning Platform

A place for the CSESoc community to learn and share their knowledge and expertise.

> ðŸŒˆ **Status update:**<br> Currently adding MDX support via @next-mdx-remote! Rationale [here](https://compclub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CW/pages/2217771174/Decision+Matrix%3A+MDX+Integration).

## Motivation

At CSESoc, CSE students gather to socialise and extend their technical knowledge outside the classroom. Educational content has previously been delivered via workshops. However, this limits people who're uncomfortable with holding workshops, or want to contribute on a smaller scale, from contributing. Having a platform where students of various backgrounds can contribute to the collective knowledge of their community is critical to its success. Hence, the CSESoc Learning Platform!

By opening up new formats of contributing such as **articles**, **videos** and **sample projects**, we hope that this empowers more people to share what they've learned with the wider CSE community.

## Code style

Prettier is used for code formatting.
